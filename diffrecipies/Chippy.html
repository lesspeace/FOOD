    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <il>
            <ul>about 1 litre sunflower oil, for frying</ul>
            <ul>2 thick skinless fillets of whiting, ling, pollock, haddock or cod (about 150g each)</ul>
            <ul>2 large Maris Piper potatoes</ul>
            <ul> tsp malt vinegar, plus extra to serve</ul>
            <ul>75g self-raising flour, plus extra for dusting</ul>
            <ul>25g cornflour</ul>
            <ul>small pinch of ground turmeric</ul>
            <ul>125g cold lager or fizzy water</ul>
        </il>
    <h2>Method</h2>
        <il>
            <ol>1. Cut the potatoes into chips and soak in cold water for 5 mins, then wash until the water runs clear. Tip into a pan of cold water with a pinch of salt and 1 tsp vinegar. Bring to a simmer, then turn down the heat and simmer gently for 10-12 mins until cooked through but not falling apart. Drain gently, then place on a tray in a single layer and chill until needed. Can be prepared a day ahead.</ol>
            <ol>2. To make the tartare sauce, chop the cornichons, capers and shallot (finely chop if you prefer a smooth sauce), then combine with the parsley, mayo and a pinch of salt. Will keep chilled for up to 24 hours.</ol>
            <ol>3. When you’re ready to fry, prepare the batter. Tip the flours and turmeric into a bowl with a pinch of salt, pour over the beer or fizzy water, and mix quickly until everything just comes together to the consistency of double cream – do not over-beat, a few lumps are fine. Keep chilled.</ol>
            <ol>4. Pour the oil into a deep, wide pan like a wok, or heat a deep-fat fryer to 180C. If using a pan or wok, ensure that it is no more than two-thirds full with oil. Heat the oil until it is shimmering and carefully lower in the chips using a slotted spoon. Fry for 8-10 mins, gently stirring occasionally until golden and crisp. Transfer to kitchen paper to drain.</ol>
